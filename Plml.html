<h1>The Python Library for MetaLinks</h1>
</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<h2>Version 0.1, April 2010</h2>
</div>
This library implements as of now a parser and set of
utilities for using <a href="http://www.metalinker.org/">Metalinks</a>,
an
XML-based way of describing how to download and install a set of files.
&nbsp;The only other programs needed are a <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> interpreter, <a href="http://codespeak.net/lxml/">lxml</a>, and <a href="http://www.gnupg.org/">GNU Privacy Guard</a> for
signature functions. &lt;bittorrent&gt; elements are not yet
supported, given the lack of support for torrents in the standard
library<span style="font-family: monospace;"> :-)&nbsp;</span>Overall
it's lightweight, even with schema checks and file text storage. Given
that this is a very new project, there are probably still some major
bugs still in the code and any feedback on them would be greatly
appreciated.
<br>
<h2>Goals and Objectives</h2>The intent is to support the entire <a href="http://www.metalinker.org/Metalink_3.0_Spec.pdf">specification</a>,
nonstandard variations, two-way porcessing, and possibly support for
revision control systems (like the one you're staring at right now).
With performance still in mind, as much of the library should be
written in Python as possible to allow for more extending and
improvement. Follow the <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">style</a>, share, and enjoy.
